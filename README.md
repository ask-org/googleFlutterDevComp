# Project Story: Ant Quest

## Inspiration

Ant Quest draws inspiration from "The Ants" game on Play Store, with a focus on environmental friendliness. We were intrigued by the idea of creating an immersive gaming experience that also highlights the importance of sustainability.

## What it does

Ant Quest immerses players into a captivating world where they assume the roles of four distinct classes of ants: warriors, scouts, medics, and collectors. Set against a backdrop of perpetual darkness, players must navigate through a maze-like environment, gathering vital resources for the survival and prosperity of the ant colony while evading menacing adversaries.

## How we built it

Building Ant Quest was a collaborative effort that involved extensive learning in Flutter, Google's UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. We utilized Flutter to develop the entire game, from its core mechanics to its user interface.

We engaged in numerous brainstorming sessions to develop unique sprites and leveraged the Flutter Casual Game Toolkit for the game's foundation.

## Challenges we ran into

Despite our dedication, we encountered several challenges along the way. Balancing gameplay mechanics, optimizing performance, and meeting project deadlines were some of the hurdles we had to overcome.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Despite not completing the game within the allocated time for the hackathon, we're proud of the progress we've made. We successfully developed a captivating game concept, refined our skills in game development, and fostered a strong sense of teamwork and collaboration.

## What we learned

The journey with Ant Quest provided us with valuable insights and learning opportunities. We deepened our understanding of Flutter, honed our skills in game development, and gained practical experience in creating responsive apps for different devices.

## What's next for Ant Quest

Although the hackathon has ended, our commitment to Ant Quest remains steadfast. We plan to continue refining and expanding the game, with aspirations of eventually publishing it on the Play Store with additional features. The experience has ignited our passion for game development, and we're eager to see Ant Quest evolve into a fully-fledged gaming experience.
